Project description:

  In a busy and dynamic world people do daily migrations from place to place all the time.
  
  Try to build an app that will allow them some of the following:
  
     * To see where are the holes on the road, along their routes. (use maps/geolocation)
     * Do a visual indication on a map when the user is approachnig the hole. 
     * User can make new entries that will indicate a new hole oppening up on the road 
     * If the hole is closed (repaired) user can close a hole on the map, delete it. 
       (At least  2-3 users must "close a hole" in order for it to desapear from the route - (hard deletion) 
     * Make user awere on which side of the road the hole is. 
       (By default user sees holes on his side of the road, but can see holes on other side as an option)
     * User can rate a hole, which is a rough estimation of how dangerous it might be.
     * User can leave short comment for a hole.
      
   Future feature expansion:
     * Try to do map ilegal landfill sites (garbage dumps)

 Implementation advice:
  Try to make use of AWS cloud resources that you are familiar with (from the current levi9 AWS cloud course) where it makes sence to do so.
